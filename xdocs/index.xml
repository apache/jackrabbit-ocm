			<subsection name="Object/Content Mapping framework (ocm)">
				<p>This Graffito subproject is an object/JCR persistence and query service. This tools lets you to persist java objects into a JCR compliant repository - including association, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and the Java collections framework. Furthermore, this jcr-mapping allows you to express queries in Java-based Criteria, as well as in JCR query language.</p> 
				
				<p>In order to easily support the JCR specification, any content application managing an high level object model can use this framework. For example, a classic Forum application contains objets like "Forum", "Topic" and "Post". Now, the data objects (pojo) can be managed by our JCR mapping tools in order to persist them into a JCR compliant repository.</p>

			<subsection name ="Why an ocm ?">
				<p>
					Sometimes it is very convenient to be able to just access the JCR nodes and properties directly from your presentation-layer for very simple things (mostly generic display). When a lot of "business logic" are involved, the JCR API can be too low level and real business objects (pojo) are more appreciate in a such case.				
				</p>

			<subsection name ="Preriquise">
				<p>
					Before using this JCR framework, you should review the JCR specication and implementations like <a   href="http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/">JackRabbit</a>.
