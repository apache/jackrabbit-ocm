		<title>The Persistence Manager API</title>
	</properties>
	<body>
		<section name="The Basic Operations">
			<p>
				When you have <a href="../engine-setup.html">create a new Persistence Manager</a> in your application, you can use this component to insert, update, delete and retrieve objects. The class 'Folder' used in the following sections should be associated to a class-descriptor defined in the  mapping descriptor.
			</p> 
			<p>
				This page describes only the main Persistence Manager methods. You can see the javadoc to get more information on the API.
			</p>
		
			
			<subsection name="Insert">
				<p>
<source>
Folder folder =  new Folder();
folder.setPath("/myfolder");
folder.set...(); // call the setter methods

persistenceManager.insert(myFolder);
					
</source>
				
				</p>
				
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Retrieve and update an object">
				<p>
<source>
Folder folder = (Folder) persistenceManager.getObject(Folder.class, "/myfolder");
folder.set...(); // call the setter methods

persistenceManager.update(myFolder);
	
</source>					

				</p>
				
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection name="Delete">
				<p>
<source>			
persistenceManager.remove("/test");
</source>
				</p>
				
			</subsection>
					
			<subsection name ="Save last changes">
			<p>After some inserts, deletes and/or updates, you can call the method <code>persistenceManager.save()</code> to apply your changes into the JCR repository.</p>
